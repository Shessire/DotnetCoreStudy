# ASP.NET CORE STUDY

This project is full of experiments from my journey learning ASP.NET Core.

Still, it is a work in progress and is not 100% polished yet. It serves as a place to document and share what I've learned so far, with new features and improvements being added over time. ðŸ˜€


## Tech Stack

**Client:** Razor Views (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Bootstrap

**Server:** ASP.NET Core MVC, C#

**Database:** Entity Framework Core, SQL Server/MySQL 


## Lessons Learned

**1. Understanding the MVC Pattern**

This shows huge different from what I initially learned when I entered coding field, MERN Stack. I gained an understanding of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and how it helps separate concerns in web applications.

**2. Razor Syntax and View Components**

I deepened my knowledge of Razor syntax and learned how to use partial views and view components to create reusable UI components that can be integrated into multiple parts of the application.

**3. Entity Framework Core**

I became familiar with using Entity Framework Core, learning how to create database models, run migrations, and perform CRUD operations efficiently.

**4. Client-Side Integration**

I integrated client-side libraries like Bootstrap and learned how to include JavaScript features in Razor views to create responsive, dynamic web pages.

*------------- Many more to come, hopefully --------------*
